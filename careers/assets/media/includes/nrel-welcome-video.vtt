Our mission here in at NREL is to move technology

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.190
more rapidly into the marketplace.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.190
This is advanced technology that has

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.600
the attributes of a sustainable energy economy.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.030
This is actually the only national laboratory that is solely devoted to

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.900
renewable technology and promoting the use of renewable technologies.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.850
A lot on the lab does research, but in our
area, we're helping to get that research

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090
out of the lab and into the marketplace.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.309
Our portfolio of industry partnerships is really

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.969
unparalleled within the National Lab system.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.540
The things that we do here really do have impact

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.360
directly to what people are doing in industry.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.019
Over the last fifteen years, we've really gone from a technology that was

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.279
"Yes at some point in the future, we'll be
able to do that. It'll be great when that happens," to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.480
now the United States and across the
world, we're doing large-scale

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.489
implementations of all sorts of
renewable technologies.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.660
I love working at NREL. 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.090
The people are fantastic and the work
that we do make such great difference

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.500
for both the nation and the world.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.960
The investment in clean energy really provides us

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.280
energy security opportunities, environmental impact improvement

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.030
that can be quite dramatic, and also
competitiveness in the marketplace.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.870
So I think NREL kind of is in a very unique place

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.140
amongst not only laboratory organizations but across the world.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.630
And how we looking to the future and
how we meet the energy needs

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.290
not only of our nation but of the world.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.740
It makes me so excited to come to work every day

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.560
to know that I'm doing something that
makes a difference and it matters

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.500
and it doesn't just matter to me or to my family

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.160
but to my community around me and the
planet as a whole.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.870
And it makes it an amazing place to work.
