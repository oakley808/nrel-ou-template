00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.230
MANAJIT SENGUPTA: I work at NREL because
of primarily the challenges, the excitement

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.130
of the work, and the people I work with.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.359
SUZY BELMONT: When people feel safe and
they feel accepted, they’re able to bring

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.840
the best parts of themselves forward, and
they’re able to bring exciting new ideas

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.680
forward because they feel like they can fail,
they feel like they can try out new things.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.110
BOBI GARRETT: A culture of inclusion is
important to me because every day when I come

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.890
to work, what I see are people that have great
ideas, they’re totally committed to the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520
mission, and they want to have an impact in
the world.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.930
MANAJIT SENGUPTA: It really makes a difference
when you can get up in the morning and say,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.719
‘I’m excited to go work with the people
around me.’ That really matters.

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.070
SUZY BELMONT: My hope for the future is
that people can come to work and don’t feel

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.920
like they have to hide a part of themselves.
So whether you’re transgender, or you come

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.920
from a biracial background, or you’re an
immigrant, or whatever it is, I would hope

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.610
that you could come to work and feel like
you are safe.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.400
BOBI GARRETT: NREL supports diversity first
of all by focusing on a talented and diverse

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.509
workforce, and you can see that in the staff
across the laboratory.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:29.990
JACK XANDER: I see NREL as sort of the
United Nations of energy. Since we have such

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.930
a diverse group from all over the world, eventually
the technology that we help develop is going

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.799
to branch out to the whole world.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.759
LINDA LUNG: I am proud to tell people that
we have folks here from 80 different countries,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.360
that we speak 30 different languages, and
that we represent 600 universities.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.780
MANAJIT SENGUPTA: We work all over the
world, and we have people from all over the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.310
world, bringing in that diversity of opinion
and thought.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.920
JACK XANDER: You can bring your background,
you can bring your culture, you can bring

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.049
your differences, and those differences will
be embraced.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.439
SUZY BELMONT: I am Suzy Belmont, and I
am part of one NREL.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.430
JACK XANDER: I am Jack Xander, and I am
part of one NREL.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.780
MANAJIT SENGUPTA: I am Manajit Sengupta,
and I am part of one NREL.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.670
LINDA LUNG: I am Linda Lung, and I am part
of one NREL.
