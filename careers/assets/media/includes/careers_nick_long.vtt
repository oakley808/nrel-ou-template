Hi, my name is Nicholas Long, I'm a researcher here

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.070
at the National Renewable Energy Lab.

3
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:06.770
I work in the commercial buildings group in the

4
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.810
analysis, tools and control section, and

5
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.820
I work on making buildings more energy efficient.

6
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.580
What keeps me here at NREL are the people. 

7
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.650
They're wicked smart, they're passionate about

8
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.060
the mission, as well, they are caring, they're loving, 

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.560
and to be honest, they're my friends now.

10
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.890
I'm proud to actually work at a place where everyone

11
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.400
has the same mission to contribute to a clean energy future. 

12
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.840
So I'm excited to come to work every day to tackle the next

13
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.351
challenge because there's plenty of them.
