I have a much broader understanding of solar cells. There is a genuine curiosity here to solve scientific problems. They'll ask me, 'What are you trying to test? How can you define the problem you're trying to solve in one sentence?' Those kinds of interactions have really helped me get at the answers.&rdquo; </p>
